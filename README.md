# CS-340-Client-Server-Development

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

  Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable starts with creating simple methods. Using methods that only do one task helps make it reusable and reduces errors in the programming. As this class went on, the requirements kept changing, but I was able to still use my original methods for the changed requirements. This way is helpful as teams can use the same code and save time, a valuable step when there are time constraints. 

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

	I find that approaching a problem as a computer scientist requires a systematic approach. Start from square one and cover your basis. Stick to the required coding format and eliminate all possible reasons for the problem one by one and from easiest to hardest. For this assignment, the only thing that changed was the introduction to the MongoDB. I was unfamiliar with the commands to manipulate the system for the task at hand. So, I used the MongDB user manual with examples on how to implement the commands. In the future, I would use a similar manual to help me navigate an unfamiliar database. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

	Computer scientists contribute to the organization by making access to information easier. They use skills in automation, analysis, data management, and other areas to create a program that is efficient and easy to use. It helps companies like Grazioso work better by saving those search commands for use later by users who do not know how to manipulate the system. It creates convenience and saves time training.
